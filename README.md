## About the project

Welcome to my "Mario MiniGame" project! ðŸŽ®

This project is an exciting journey into the world of classic gaming, brought to life with modern web technologies. By utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS alongside game development principles, I've recreated a mini version of the iconic Mario game.

**Objective**:

With this project, my aim is to demonstrate my passion for programming. Through the implementation of core game mechanics such as player movement, collision detection, and interactive elements like platforms and obstacles, I'm showcasing my ability to translate ideas into engaging user experiences. This project not only highlights my technical skills but also reflects my commitment to continuous learning and improvement in the field of web development.
